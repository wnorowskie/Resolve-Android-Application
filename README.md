### About Resolve

---

üìÖ Resolve is a social-media like platform with a focus on scheduling. Upload your schedule and connect with friends to easily plan events and find meeting times that fit everyone's needs.

### Implementation

---

üí° Our prototype implements the following features:

- Signing up
- Signing in 
- Authentication
- Creating a basic profile (using a default profile photo)
- Adding events to your schedule
- Viewing your schedule in a daily format
- Viewing your friends' schedules 
- Viewing your friends list and pending friend requests
- Accepting/denying a friend request
- Searching for another user
- Viewing your organization and group lists

### Limitations and Simplifying Assumptions

---
‚ùó The following limitations and assumptions are made for our application:
- When adding a friend, we assume that a user will search for another user using their exact username.
- We are not able to create groups or organizations, so the "groups" and "organizations" screens will have default groups and orgs displayed.
- We do not have any username or password requirements (length, special characters, etc.)

### How to Run

---
üí≠ What to know before using our application:
- When you first use our application, you must use the sign up (create account) screen, since you do not have an account yet.
  However, once you create an account you can use the log in screen (your username and password will be stored).
- Once you sign in, our app will automatically take you to your profile screen. From there, you can access your friends, groups, orgs, and schedule.
- To view your schedule, click the "schedule" button on your profile screen.
- To add an event to your schedule, click the plus sign on the schedule-viewer screen.
