# Vision Document
## Introduction
We envision a social media-designed platform that will provide Vassar students with the ability to connect with friends, clubs, and organizations to compare schedules and more effectively schedule events. The ability to connect students with other students, clubs, organizations, athletic teams, employers, etc. will be a valuable asset to the Vassar community, as the ability to see members' schedules will lead to maximizing event attendance. The goal will be to include third-party systems related to Vassar (e.g. Vassar OneLogin, AskBanner, Moodle) for schedule integration and authentication through OneLogin.

We propose to centralize coordinating events between individuals and groups, as opposed to trying to communicate on various platforms. The value comes from the ability to coordinate between large groups of people efficiently and the full-campus integration. This design could be moved to work at any college campus, and can easily scale for larger workplaces, but our initial implementation will focus on the Vassar community.

## Key Features:
- Users create a profile similar to most popular social media platforms, with the added ability to create their weekly schedule to compare with other users and organizations.
- Users request to follow other users, create groups of individual users, and request to join organizations. Users can assign a visibility level to each of their events (e.g. Close Friends, Followers Only, Organization Only)
- Search tool to find other individual users/organizations. 
- Group Integration: users can create informal groups with  other users such as friends, study groups, etc. where they can collectively plan group events and members can seamlessly add them to their own weekly schedule.
- Organizations: a user can create an organization, of which they become the leader, and manage an organization schedule which is unique to the organization. Group leaders accept requests to join the organization and add events to the organization schedule as a means of centralizing the planning of events. Organization leaders have the ability to view members' schedules for better planning, and they can view scheduling conflicts between the organization schedule and members' schedules.
