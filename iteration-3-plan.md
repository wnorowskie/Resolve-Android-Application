# Iteration 3 Plan
- Continue Developing the UI and supplementary Java.
- Focus on following use case:
    1. Displaying Schedule
    2. Managing The Schedule
    3. Update Profile UI
    4. Incoporate Navigation Bar/System

### Displaying Schedule
- Now that user can add events to their schedule, creating a UI
for them to view and interact with.
- Should be its own screen that is accessed from profile

### Managing The Schedule
- Once user can view their schedule they should have the ability to edit it
- Either a seperate managing/permissions screen, or built-in functionaly
    - if you click on an event you can edit its contents.

### Update Profile UI
- Provide a more comprehensive profile page that allows access to all relevant features
- Perhaps displaying follower/following count, being able to edit profile photo, etc.

### Create Navigation Bar/Systeam
- Take the functionality that is currently available under the profile and create a navigation system for it.
- Most popularly is a downbar nav in social media application. Allows users to access various screens no matter where they are.
